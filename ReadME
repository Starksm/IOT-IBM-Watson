Arduino Uno/Yun Samples
This repository contains samples for connecting Arduino Uno/Yun devices to the IBM Watson IoT Platform

The events that are emitted in this sample are:

Internal sensor temperature
Pre-requisite setup for the 2 flows
Arduino Uno
Connect Ethernet / Wifi shield to Arduino Uno

Connect Ethernet cable to the Ethernet / Wifi shield

Install sketch on desktop / laptop

Download Paho mqtt library, for Ardunio, from this link (https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.paho/downloads) in the sketch
a) To load it into the Arduino IDE, the zip file should be downloaded intact, without unzipping.
b) Then in the IDE: Select Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library and select the zip file

Connect the USB cable to the Arduino Uno and other end to desktop / laptop which has the sketch installed on it

The samples folder of this repository (https://github.com/ibm-messaging/iot-arduino) contains 2 folders, each containining 1 flow - a) Quickstart flow b) Registered flow

Compile the 2 skectch codes (corresponding to the flows)

Depending upon the requirement, push one of the flows to the Arduino device

Reset the Ethernet / Wifi shield

Wait for about 10 seconds and the flow starts working

Arduino Yun
Configure Arduino Yun to connect to your WiFi Network
Follow steps-3,4,5,6 from Arduino Uno
Pick the sketch names - quickstart_yun.ino (https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/device-arduino/blob/master/samples/quickstart/quickstart_yun.ino) / registered_yun.ino (https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/device-arduino/blob/master/samples/registered/registered_yun.ino) for Arduino Yun
Continue following steps-7 to 10 from Arduino Uno
Quickstart flow
Modify the clientId, in the sketch code, by providing the values in the following format "d:quickstart:iotsample-arduino:aabbccde02", by replacing "aabbccde02" with the MAC Address of the device
Open the quickstart dashboard (http://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/#/)
Provide the MAC Address (in case of the example, its aabbccde02) in the textbox "Ready to View data?"
Registered Flow
This has 2 flows

Registered Flow from device
Registered Flow to device
Registered Flow from device and to device
Modify the AUTHTOKEN in the sketch code
Modify the MS_PROXY, in the sketch code, by providing the values in the following format "uguhsp.messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com", by replacing "uguhsp" with your organization
Modify the CLIENT_ID, in the sketch code, by providing the values in the following format "d:uguhsp:iotsample-arduino:00aabbccde03", by replacing "aabbccde03" with the Device Id and "uguhsp" with the organization and "iotsample-arduino" with the device type that you entered when creating the device.
Use mqttpublisher / mqttsubscriber to publish and subscribe the commands / events sent to / received from the Arduino Uno
Modify the mac Address (given in the sample as { 0x00, 0xAA, 0xBB, 0xCC, 0xDE, 0x03 } ) by the MAC Address of the Ethernet shield. This applies only for Arduino Uno, no change required in Arduino Yun sketch.
Development
The code contains comments, which explains how to modify the parameters
In case of registered flow, you will have to connect to https://internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/dashboard/#/ and create the following
Organization
Device
Auth tokens
